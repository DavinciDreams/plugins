## Workflow

### Infrastructure (5 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Infrastructure explorer analyzes current infrastructure, dependencies, and architecture
2. **Planning** - Design infrastructure approach, ask clarifying questions, get user approval
3. **Execution** - Cloud architect, CI/CD engineer, and security engineer work in parallel
4. **Review** - SRE engineer validates reliability, monitoring, and observability
5. **Summary** - Final infrastructure, pipelines, and documentation

### Deployment (5 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Understand deployment requirements and existing infrastructure
2. **Planning** - Outline deployment strategy and automation approach
3. **Execution** - Build pipelines, implement security controls, and set up monitoring
4. **Review** - Validate deployment reliability and operational readiness
5. **Summary** - Production-ready deployment and runbooks

### Migration (5 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Analyze source infrastructure and migration requirements
2. **Planning** - Design migration strategy and risk mitigation plan
3. **Execution** - Implement infrastructure, migration pipelines, and security controls
4. **Review** - Validate migration success and operational readiness
5. **Summary** - Complete migration and documentation

### Optimization (3 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Identify optimization opportunities
2. **Execution** - Implement improvements
3. **Review** - Validate performance gains

## Skills

- **cloud-platforms** - AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud services and best practices
- **infrastructure-as-code** - Terraform, CloudFormation, ARM templates, Kubernetes manifests, and state management
- **ci-cd-pipelines** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, build and test strategies, and deployment patterns
- **monitoring-observability** - Prometheus and Grafana, CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Stackdriver, logging, alerting, and SRE practices
