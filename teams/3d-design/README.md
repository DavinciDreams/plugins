## Workflow

### Asset Creation (5 phases)

1. **Discovery** - 3D analyst researches requirements, references, and technical specifications
2. **Planning** - Design production approach, ask clarifying questions, get user approval
3. **Execution** - Modeler, rigger, animator, texturer, and VTuber specialist work in parallel
4. **Review** - Asset optimizer checks for quality, performance, and technical compliance
5. **Summary** - Document all changes and deliverables

### Character Creation (5 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Understand character requirements, style, and technical constraints
2. **Planning** - Outline character production pipeline and specifications
3. **Execution** - Model character, rig for animation, create animations, apply textures
4. **Review** - Optimize for target platform and validate quality
5. **Summary** - Final deliverables and integration instructions

### Scene Creation (5 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Understand scene requirements, environment, and assets
2. **Planning** - Design scene composition and asset requirements
3. **Execution** - Model environment assets, apply materials, optimize for performance
4. **Review** - Validate scene performance and visual quality
5. **Summary** - Final scene files and documentation

### VTuber Avatar Creation (5 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Understand VTuber requirements, style, and tracking needs
2. **Planning** - Design avatar and tracking configuration
3. **Execution** - Create VRM avatar, set up face tracking, configure expressions
4. **Review** - Validate tracking performance and avatar quality
5. **Summary** - Final VRM files and setup instructions

### Asset Optimization (3 phases)

1. **Discovery** - Analyze current asset performance and optimization opportunities
2. **Execution** - Reduce polygons, optimize textures, create LODs
3. **Review** - Validate optimization results and performance improvements
